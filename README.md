# Demo article publishing application based on electron-react-boilerplate

Demo article publishing application based on
[Electron](http://electron.atom.io/), [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux), [React Router](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router), [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/docs/), [React Transform HMR](https://github.com/gaearon/react-transform-hmr)

## Features

* see a list of articles rendered as Material UI cards
* create a new article
* remove an article
* edit an article
* for each article choose a photo, which is resized (client side) in 3 different dimensions
* all articles are persisted in localStorage
* validation for non-empty author, title, content and featuredImage fields
* INTERNATIONALIZATION SUPPORT - use the menu in the title bar to switch between English and French

## Technical details

* state is managed by Redux
* persistence of state in localStorage thanks to redux-localstorage
* Roboto font is loaded locally thanks to roboto-fontface npm package
* React Router manages navigation between the 3 pages: HomePage, AddArticlePage and EditArticlePage
* react-router-redux keeps the URL in sync with the Redux store
* material-ui provides the widgets
* resizing the images client side is done using a canvas element
* resized images are saved as data URL strings (base64). Saving them as ArrayBuffer or Blob would have complicated the serialization in localStorage as these objects don't have a toString implementation
* the "high res" 200px image is shown on the card (yeah, it does not look to good) and the med res 150px image is shown in the article editor
* internationalization is done without any 3rd party package. See [this commit](https://github.com/SergiuB/publish-demo/commit/c25cbaafa7b44f543def368bf1db318f2f226d3c) for details. Translations are located in the i18n folder.
